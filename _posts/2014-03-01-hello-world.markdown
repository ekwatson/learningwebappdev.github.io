Welcome! This page/blog will be used to keep readers updated of issues and news
related to the book "Learning Web Application Development" now available from
O'Reilly Media!

Our Github examples aren't quite finished yet, but they will be in the near
future. In the meantime if you run into any problems, or have questions, feel
free to file a Github issue on our
[examples page](http://github.com/semmypurewal/learningwebappdev),
or [tweet at me](http://twitter.com/semmypurewal).

I'm always happy to help!
