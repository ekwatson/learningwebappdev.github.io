At the end of Chapter 2, on page 50, the last step of the memorization exercise
says to _commit the style.css changes to your repository_. Since CSS isn't
covered until Chapter 3 this shouldn't be there.

Instead, it should say _commit the <strong>index.html</strong> changes to your
repository_.

Thanks to [Matthew Brockway](http://twitter.com/BothXP) for reporting this!
