On page 205, the Express server that serves up `todos.json` is missing a slash.

Specifically, the line that looks like

    app.get("todos.json", function (req, res) {

should look like this

    app.get("/todos.json", function (req, res) {

Thanks to [Dan Candela](https://github.com/dcandela) for finding this and reporting it!
